        <p>World Vision coming into Saboba district as a humanitarian and development organization, has brought significant change
        in the lives of children, families and the communities in the district most especially the provision of portable
        drinking water, assisting children from poor homes to be able to get education, etc.
        When the novel Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, World Vision in the past months have donated PPEâ€™s to several
        organizations, departments, Hospital, clinic, etc. to assist in the fight against the pandemic. Just last month World
        Vision donated some Veronica Buckets and PPEs to organization, Churches and Mosques in the district amount to 8,000 US
        dollars.
</p>
        <p>This time known for their good works in the district, the Agric Section of World Vision led by Mr. Maxwell Amedi,
        donated some farm inputs to some 250 farmers in the district to help avert the economic hardship our farmers are
        enduring as a result of the novel COVID-19 pandemic. The farm inputs included; 1,000 kg Mazie (wang data), 1,600 kg
        Soybean (janguma/favour), 200 litres of Target, 200 litres of Sunfuro, 1,525grams of Water meion seed, 400 (25kg) of
        Urea bags, 800 (25kg) NPK bags and 100  Cutlasses. </p>

        <p>World Vision as an organization is working for the wellbeing of children, so children were one of the criteria used in
        selecting the families which are more hit by covid-19
        The DCE Hon. George Bingrini, in the company of the coordinating director of the district assembly received the items on
        behalf of the district assembly and handed it over to Agric. Director in Saboba to be distributed to the beneficiary
        farmers. The DCE also used the opportunity to update farmers that, the district has cashew seedling and so interested
        farmers should contact the Agric. Department in Saboba.
